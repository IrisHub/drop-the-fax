DroptheFax is "internet performance art".  It's a React application with several lambda functions in AWS as a backend.

During the COVID19 pandemic, many colleges raised student tuition while providing a worse quality of education.

Drop the Fax aimed to highlight the absurdity of placing additional financial burden on already struggling students. The premise was simple -- most institutions receive invoices for purchases; we aimed to (in one simple button) send fax invoices demanding restitution to 13 university presidents.  

Students sent over 35,000 fax messages. 

Even if some were certainly blocked by spam filters,it was a fantastic way to investigate the limits of and approaches to applying technology to social issues.
